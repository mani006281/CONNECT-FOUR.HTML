I created this Connect Four game using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a fun two-player game where Red and Yellow players take turns dropping discs into a 7-column, 6-row grid. The game checks automatically after each move to see if someone has won—whether it’s vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. You can easily reset the game and start over. It was a great way for me to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and building real-time logic in the browser. Simple, clean, and interactive—this project made learning frontend development much more enjoyable!
