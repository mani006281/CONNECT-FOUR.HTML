This Connect Four game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a 6×7 grid where two players (Red and Yellow) take turns dropping discs into columns. The game checks for a winner after every move by evaluating all directions — horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. JavaScript handles game logic and DOM updates, while CSS styles the board and player tokens. A reset button allows players to start a new game. This project demonstrates core frontend concepts like dynamic element creation, event handling, and game logic implementation in a clean, interactive UI—ideal for beginners learning web development.
